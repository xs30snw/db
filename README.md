# db

**Database** is a convinient way to structure and store information efficiently (e.g. in tables). A **relational database** uses keys to link pieces of data from one table to another, whereas each **key** represent some relation (e.g. a unique identifier of an owner). Three types of relationship are possible between two tables :
- **one-to-one**,
- **one-to-many**,
- **many-to-many**.

### A list of open-source databases:
- **MySQL** - one of the most popular choices for data organization and storage;
- **PostgreSQL** - has advanced level of complexity, array data type, support for python scripts;
- **MongoDB** - stores similar data in chunks;
- **Redis** - great for caching, data lives entirely in RAM;
- **SQLite** - a portable solution without need for setting up a server;
- **Cassandra** - uses columns of data instead of rows, good write speed;
- **MariaDB** - a MySQL close alternative, absolutely free;
- **Neo4j** - for graphs and networks.
